# This is the description of the upcoming project
I have jet to decide on the project so I will use some suggestions from YouTube and from the course of *Python programming*.
## There are some **Python** projects I would like to conduct:
---
First of all, I want to create a programm to download stuff frome YT. Though I don't know how to do it better.
1. I can watch a video and just copy the code to make it work..
2. I also can watch it, learn used functions and dictionaries and then start

### That's it for now.
